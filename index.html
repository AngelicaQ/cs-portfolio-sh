                 <p>Hello, beautiful people of the Internet! My name is Angel, 
                 and I'm a tenth grade student at Summit Shasta High School. 
                 (To any person and/or alien that may be reading this in the 
                 future, this was written in 2015, and Summit Shasta is a high 
                 school with non-existent walls and no chairs.) I'm just a really 
                 nerdy kid that has way too much time on their hands but never knows 
                 what to do with it. If you asked me what I wanted to do in the 
                 future, it's most likely that I would just stroke my chin and 
                 mutter something "wise" while slowly walking away. Although I have
                 no long term goals in mind, all I want to do is use my work to make 
                 people smile and laugh ... and maybe make them pee their pants.</p>

                     <li>Did I mention how much I liked the word "dank"?</li>
